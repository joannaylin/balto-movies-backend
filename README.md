## Items Completed
- Database created using sqlite3
- Successfully imported csv data into table
- Index route, to grab all movies, returned data (limit to 10 due to file size of csv)


## Struggles and Learnings
- Struggled with formatting csv data into table such that when returned to frontend, the data is formatted correctly. (Ideally, an array of objects, with i.e. key of "title" pointing to value of "Movie Title" etc.) This led to a later issue of being able to search for items with a specific requirement in mind (search functionality).
- Using cursor object to grab data from the database

## If I could do it over again...
- Understand the process of importing a csv into a database and how to format database from said information.
